# stroke-lesion-segmentation
Supplementary materials for the publication "Deep learning-based automated lesion segmentation on mouse stroke magnetic resonance images".

This repository contains an interactive Jupyter notebook to run our deep learning stroke lesion detection model on mouse MRI scans. 
Note, the notebook contains a condensed, inference-only version of the pipeline so that not the full [Voxelytics](https://voxelytics.com) deep learning environment is required.

## Requirements 
- Python 3.9+ 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Attribution
